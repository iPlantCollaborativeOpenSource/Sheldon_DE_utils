bam2wig.pl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

bam2wig.pl [--options...] <filename>
  
    Options:
  --in <filename>
  --out <filename> 
  --position [start|mid|span]
  --coverage
  --pe
  --splice
  --shift <integer>
  --strand [f|r]
  --inter

  --(no)gz
  --help


=head1 OPTIONS

The command line flags and descriptions:

=over 4

=item --in <filename>

Specify the input Bam alignment file. The file should be sorted and 
indexed, although it may be indexed automatically

=item --out <filename>

Specify the output filename. By default it uses the base name of the 
input file.

=item --position [start|mid|span]

Specify the position of the alignment coordinate which should be 
recorded. Several positions are accepted: the start (5') position of 
the alignment, the midpoint of the alignment, or at all positions 
along the length of the alignment (span). Note that the  
span option gives coverage but not a true count of the number of 
alignments, unlike start or mid. With paired-end alignments, the 
positions are relative to the entire insert fragment defined by two 
alignments. The default value is start for single-end and mid for 
paired-end alignments.

=item --coverage

Calculate the coverage of the alignments over the genome at single 
base pair resolution. This ignores the position, strand, shift, and 
log options. It uses faster low level interfaces to the Bam file to 
eke out performance. It is equivalent to specifying --position=span, 
--inter, no strand, and no log.

=item --pe

The Bam file consists of paired-end alignments, and only properly 
mapped pairs of alignments will be considered. The default is to 
treat all alignments as single-end.

=item --splice

The Bam file single-end alignments may contain splices, where the 
read is split between two separate alignments. This is most common 
with splice junctions from RNA-Seq data. In this case, treat each 
alignment as a separate tag. 

=item --shift <integer>

Shift the positions of all single-end alignments towards the 3' end by 
the indicated number of basepairs. The value should be 1/2 the average 
length of the insert library sequenced. Useful for ChIP-Seq applications.

=item --strand [f|r]

Only process those single-end alignments which map to the indicated 
strand. Default is to take all alignments regardless of strand.

=item --inter

Specify whether or not to record interpolating positions of 0. If 
true, a fixedStep wig file (step=1 span=1) is written, otherwise a 
variableStep wig file is written that only records the positions 
where a tag is found. This will also work with bedGraph output. 
The default behavior is to not record empty positions.

=item --log [2|10]

Transform the count to a log scale. Specify the base number, 2 or 
10. Note that positions with a count of 0 are not converted and 
remain 0, and positions with a count of 1 are converted to a 
log value of 0. Therefore, only really useful with Bam alignment 
files with high count numbers. Default is to not transform the count.

=item --(no)track

Specify whether or not to include a track line in the wig file. In 
general, track lines are not required when further converting to a 
BigWig file.

=item --bed

Specify whether or not to write a bedGraph (chromosome start stop value) 
file or a traditional fixedStep or variableStep wiggle file. The 
default is false.

=item --bw

Specify whether or not the wig file should be further converted into 
an indexed, compressed, binary BigWig file. The default is false.

=item --bwapp </path/to/bedGraphToBigWig or /path/to/wigToBigWig>

Specify the full path to Jim Kent's BigWig conversion utility. Two 
different utilities may be used, bedGraphToBigWig or wigToBigWig, 
depending on the format of the wig file generated. The bedGraphToBigWig 
is preferred only because of slightly lower memory overhead. The 
default is to search the environment path for the executable.

=item --(no)gz

Specify whether (or not) the output file should be compressed with 
gzip. The default is compress the output unless a BigWig file is 
requested.

=item --help

Display this POD documentation.

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program will enumerate aligned sequence tags and generate a wig, 
or optionally BigWig, file. Each position in the wig file records the 
number of alignments which map to that position. Alignments may be 
counted at the start (5') or midpoint positions, or optionally 
enumerated at every position across the alignment (resulting in a 
coverage map rather than an alignment enumeration). Further, alignments 
may be selected according to strand, and the position may be shifted 
towards the 3' direction (for ChIP-Seq applications).

Note that the memory consumed by the program is roughly proportional to 
the size of the chromosome, particularly for dense read coverage. 
The total number of alignments should not matter. 

Counting and processing the alignments is a lengthy process, and may 
require multiple hours for large numbers, especially for splices. A 
simple coverage map should be much faster to calculate, but loses the 
options of selecting strand or shifting coordinates.

Conversion to a bigWig file requires the installation of Jim Kent's 
bedGraphToBigWig or wigToBigWig utilities. Conversion from a 
bedGraph file is slightly more memory efficient, and is automatically 
chosen if the user does not specify. 

More information about wiggle files can be found at 
http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/wiggle.html, bedGraph at 
http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bedgraph.html, and bigWig at
